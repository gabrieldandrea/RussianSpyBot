But then we started making our own houses..business'..and we all split up and we changed ideas individually. Minecraft in it of itself isn't a real life simulator..its a game!! for fun!! I think we shouldve just had 1 big community house..sharing design ideas, going on adventures and playing minecraft for what it is. If we want a real life simulator we should bought a game designed for that.");
